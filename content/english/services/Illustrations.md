### Illustrations

Your illustrations should have a purpose whether it provides essential or supplementary information, attract readers, or prompt an emotional response. Some texts require illustration. Others can be made more effective by adding illustration. Keep in mind that most people normally look at pictures first before the words in your book are read.

Illustrations may be artwork or photographs.

Artwork includes drawings, graphs, and maps. It can be printed in black and white, in black and white with one or more additional colors, or in full color. Photographs can be printed in black and white, in another color, or in full color.

Our creative editors will help you make your point clear by using a visual imagery so you can depict, explain, and/or decorate the words in your manuscript. They do not stop with the illustrations that come with your manuscript. They listen to your vision and ask themselves whether more are needed or desirable to tell a great story.

Editing illustrations needs a sympathetic, trained, and alert eye, just like editing words. We’re here to help you – we’re here to make your illustrations stand out!

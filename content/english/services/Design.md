### Design

Good design in print helps make your message clear and effective. It also saves your readers’ time and effort because the message is easy to read.

Planning a design is part of planning a publication. Our professional designers and artists are familiar with the principles of publication design. They will work closely with you and our editors not only to create a book cover or design that would best represent the purpose of your book but also that stands out and readable for your readers.

We always think about how your texts will be presented physically. We ensure that the layout of the cover and the inside of your book meet the rules and standards of all formatting requirements by various e-book and print-on-demand distribution channels.

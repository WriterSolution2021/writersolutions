### Editing

We understand that editing is more than a craft. Our editors’ primary function is to make your text as easy as possible to read and understand. We respect and work closely with authors like you…You as the author get the final say on every change.


>Editing a manuscript can involve many different tasks with an intention of producing a correct, consistent, accurate and making sure your manuscript is complete. Some of the most important of these are the following:

1. Editorial Evaluations
2. Substantive Editing
3. Copy Editing
4. Proofreading

#### Editorial Evaluation ($500)
An editorial evaluation will provide you with an honest assessment of your book’s marketability and how much editing is required (or, how much rewriting is required before you even consider an editor) prior to taking your book to the publishing stage.

In an editorial evaluation, a professional editor will read and assess your manuscript from start to finish without making any changes. Keep in mind that our editor is working for you – providing you guidance for your own best interest. You will be provided an objective assessment outlining the strengths and weaknesses of your book in an honest and forthright manner, and will provide you some guidance in ways it could be improved.

Editorial evaluation is $500 for manuscripts up to 75, 000 words and 0.7¢ per additional word thereafter.

#### Substantive Editing (3.9¢/word)
Our substantive editor will help you define your goals, identify your readers, and shape your manuscript in the best possible way.

A comprehensive editing involves a complete overhaul of your manuscript. It focuses on the content, organization, and presentation of your text from the title to the ending.

#### Copy Editing (2¢/word)
Our copy editors will check your manuscript for grammar, spelling, style, and punctuation issues before it’s prepared for proofreading. Our copy editor may also do a rewrite or revise, if necessary, to fix any problems with transitions, wordiness, jargon, and to ensure the style of the piece fits with the publication.

#### Proofreading (1.3¢/word)
Our proofreaders will have the final set of eyes to look for minor text and formatting errors and confirm if your manuscript is ready for publication. They will not suggest major changes to the text.
